\section{Object definition}
\label{sec:objectdef}

This section describes the definitions of the physics objects employed in the analysis (electron, muon, jets and missing transverse energy). For the kinematic variables used in the analysis, they are all calculated with respect to the primary vertex selected in the event.

\subsection{Leptons}

\subsubsection{Electron definition}

\subsubsection{Muon definition}

\subsection{Jets}
Jets are built from topological clusters, formed from calorimeter cell deposits, and calibrated to the electromagnetic (EM) scale. They are reconstructed using the anti-kt algorithm with a distance parameter of R = 0.4. The jet four-vector is then corrected for the beamspot and a jet energy scale calibration is performed.

\subsection{Missing Transverse Energy ($E_T^{\mbox{miss}}$)}
The missing transverse momentum is reconstructed according to the JetEtMiss group recommendations using the METMaker tool\cite{MET-Utilities}. $E^{\mbox{miss}}_T$ is comprised of the negative vector sum of $p_T$ of physics objects (leptons, jets, etc.) and a so-called soft term. $E^{\mbox{miss}}_T$ in Run-2 is reconstructed using a track-based soft 498 term (TST)\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-027} in addition to the hard terms arising from photons, electrons, muons, $\tau$ leptons, and jets.
